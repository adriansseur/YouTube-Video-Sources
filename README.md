# Porfolio Project: YouTube-Video-Sources

This project is included in my portfolio because it shows both my capacity to build a web app with React and my UI Design skills as I take an existing website and make it much more readable.

## Description

Built with React using Create React App.

## Motivation

I wanted to learn more about a video from the popular YouTube Channel Kurzgesagt. The video in question is titled "Can YOU Fix Climate Change?" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiw6_JakZFc). Kurzgesagt also publishes a Google Sites website with further readings and sources (https://sites.google.com/view/sources-climate-how/). It is full of interesting content but I found it very hard to read. There is a mix of quotes from the original source, comments from Kurzgesagt, images, and more. So I decided to make a web app that would make it easy to read.

## Description

I categorized the content on Kurzgesagt's original site into 4 types:

1. source - place the info came from
2. commentary - words from Kurzgesagt about the information and how it ties to their narrative
3. link - a hyperlink to the source
4. quote - the information itself that is being referenced (sometimes a quote from a text, other times an image, graph, or table)

Then I styled these elements in a way that made clear their category, something the original website does not.

## Future Work

I plan to add a navigation column where users can jump to a desired quote without having to scroll endlessly.
